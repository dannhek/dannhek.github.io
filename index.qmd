I want to understand the world. Many people try to answer empirical questions with non-empirical evidence. I want to change that. I work with [Dr. Brian Patterson](https://emed.wisc.edu/people/brian-patterson/) to research the effects of informatics-based interventions in the emergency department on patient outcomes, especially falls and cognitive impairment screenings.

### Research Interests
